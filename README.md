Won first place in mechatronics bracket-style competition against 24 other robots in the class! Our team of four completed this 3.5 week project to create an autonomous bot that can dispense balls into seesaw-like boxes in order to open a gate. Once the gate is open the bot can drive through and enter their opponentâ€™s starting area and win the game. The robot can only carry 4 balls at a time and can only reload at the marked station. The robot only has the walls, black and grey tape on the ground, and a series of IR beacons of different frequency and duty cycle as control inputs (no communication from the team is allowed once the game begins). Game strategy must be programmed into the robot to determine the optimal method of depositing, stealing, and reloading balls. The task must be completed in 2 minutes and 10 seconds, at which time the robots shut off and whoever has placed the most balls on their side wins.

Final project for ME210: Intro to Mechatronics course at Stanford University.
